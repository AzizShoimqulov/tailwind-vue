# Tailwind + Vue (minimal starter)

This is a minimal Vue 3 + Vite project pre-wired with Tailwind CSS.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Notes
- Tailwind is configured in `tailwind.config.cjs` and imported in `src/assets/index.css`.
- `src/App.vue` contains a simple button to demonstrate interactivity and Tailwind styling.
